Edlib
=====

Lightweight, super fast library for sequence alignment using edit (Levenshtein) distance. Edlib is actually a C/C++ library, and this package is it's wrapper for Python.

The python extension Edlib has two functions, `align()` and `getNiceAlignment()`:

.. code:: python

    align(query, target, [mode], [task], [k])

.. code:: python

    getNiceAlignment(alignResutl, query, target)

Python Edlib has mostly the same API as C/C++ Edlib, so make sure to check out `C/C++ Edlib docs <http://github.com/Martinsos/edlib>`_ for more code examples, details on API and how Edlib works.

--------
Features
--------

* Calculates **edit distance**.
* It can find **optimal alignment path** (instructions how to transform first sequence into the second sequence).
* It can find just the **start and/or end locations of alignment path** - can be useful when speed is more important than having exact alignment path.
* Supports **multiple alignment methods**: global(**NW**), prefix(**SHW**) and infix(**HW**), each of them useful for different scenarios.
* You can **extend character equality definition**, enabling you to e.g. have wildcard characters, to have case insensitive alignment or to work with degenerate nucleotides.
* It can easily handle small or **very large** sequences, even when finding alignment path.
* **Super fast** thanks to Myers's bit-vector algorithm.

NOTE: Size of alphabet has to be <= 256 (meaning that query and target together must have <= 256 unique values).

API
---

Edlib has two functions, `align()` and `getNiceAlignment()`:

.. code:: python

    align(query, target, [mode], [task], [k], [additionalEqualities])

Aligns `query` against `target` with edit distnace. 

**Parameters:**

* `query` --- (Required) Combined with query must have no more than 256 unique values. String or bytes.
* `target` --- (Required) Combined with target must have no more than 256 unique values. String or bytes. 
* `mode` --- (Default `"NW"`, optional) Alignment method do be used. 
  - `"NW"` for global (default)
  - `"HW"` for infix
  - `"SHW"` for prefix
* `task` --- (Default `"distance"`, optional) Tells edlib what to calculate. The less there is to calculate,
    the faster it is. Possible value are (from fastest to slowest):
  - `"distance"` - find edit distance and end locations in target. Default.
  - `"locations"` - find edit distance, end locations and start locations.
  - `"path"` - find edit distance, start and end locations and alignment path.
* `k` -- (Default `-1`, optional) Max edit distance to search for - the lower this value,
    the faster is calculation. Set to -1 (default) to have no limit on edit distance.
* `additionalEqualities` (Default `None`, optional) List of pairs of characters or hashable objects, 
    where each pair defines two values as equal. This way you can extend edlib's definition of equality 
    (which is that each character is equal only to itself).This can be useful e.g. when you want edlib to be case insensitive, 
    or if you want certain characters to act as a wildcards. Set to None (default) if you do not want to extend edlib's default equality definition.

**Returns:**

`align()` returns a python dictioanry with the following fields:
* `editDistance`  -1 if it is larger than k.
* `alphabetLength`  Length of unique characters in 'query' and 'target'
* `locations`  List of locations, in format `[(start, end)]`.
* `cigar`  Cigar is a standard format for alignment path.
Here we are using extended cigar format, which uses following symbols:
  - Match: `"="`
  - Insertion to target: `"I"`
  - Deletion from target: `"D"`
  - Mismatch: `"X"`.
e.g. cigar of `"5=1X1=1I"` means "5 matches, 1 mismatch, 1 match, 1 insertion (to target)".


To learn more about this function, type :code:`help(edlib.align)` in your python interpreter.


.. code:: python

    getNiceAlignment(alignResutl, query, target)

Output alignments from `align()` in NICE format. 

**Parameters:**

* `alignResult` --- (Required) Output of the method `align()`. 
    NOTE: The method align() requires the argument `task="path"`

* `query` --- (Required) The exact query used for `alignResult`
* `target`  --- (Required) The exact target used for `alignResult`
* `gapSymbol` --- (Default `"-"`, optional) String used to represent gaps in the alignment between query and target


**Returns:**

`getNiceAlignment()` returns the alignment in NICE format, which is human-readable visual representation of how the query and target align to each other. e.g., for "telephone" and "elephant", it would look like:

::
   telephone
    |||||.|.
   -elephant

It is represented as dictionary with following fields:
  - `query_aligned`
  - `matched_aligned` ('|' for match, '.' for mismatch, ' ' for insertion/deletion)
  - `target_aligned`
Normally you will want to print these three in order above joined with newline character.

Usage
-----
.. code:: python

    import edlib

    result = edlib.align("elephant", "telephone")
    print(result["editDistance"])  # 3
    print(result["alphabetLength"])  # 8
    print(result["locations"])  # [(None, 8)]
    print(result["cigar"])  # None

    result = edlib.align("ACTG", "CACTRT", mode="HW", task="path", additionalEqualities=[("R", "A"), ("R", "G")])
    print(result["editDistance"])  # 0
    print(result["alphabetLength"])  # 5
    print(result["locations"])  # [(1, 4)]
    print(result["cigar"])  # "4="

    result = edlib.align("elephant", "telephone", task="path")  ## users must use 'task="path"' 
    niceAlign = edlib.getNiceAlignment(result, "elephant", "telephone")
    print(niceAlign['query_aligned'])  # "-elephant"
    print(niceAlign['matched_aligned'])  # "-|||||.|."
    print(niceAlign['target_aligned'])  # "telephone"

Benchmark
---------

I run a simple benchmark on 7 Feb 2017 (using timeit, on Python3) to get a feeling of how Edlib compares to other Python libraries: `editdistance <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/editdistance>`_ and `python-Levenshtein <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-Levenshtein>`_.

As input data I used pairs of DNA sequences of different lengths, where each pair has about 90% similarity.

::

   #1: query length: 30, target length: 30
   edlib.align(query, target): 1.88µs
   editdistance.eval(query, target): 1.26µs
   Levenshtein.distance(query, target): 0.43µs

   #2: query length: 100, target length: 100
   edlib.align(query, target): 3.64µs
   editdistance.eval(query, target): 3.86µs
   Levenshtein.distance(query, target): 14.1µs

   #3: query length: 1000, target length: 1000
   edlib.align(query, target): 0.047ms
   editdistance.eval(query, target): 5.4ms
   Levenshtein.distance(query, target): 1.9ms

   #4: query length: 10000, target length: 10000
   edlib.align(query, target): 0.0021s
   editdistance.eval(query, target): 0.56s
   Levenshtein.distance(query, target): 0.2s

   #5: query length: 50000, target length: 50000
   edlib.align(query, target): 0.031s
   editdistance.eval(query, target): 13.8s
   Levenshtein.distance(query, target): 5.0s

-----------
Development
-----------

Run :code:`make build` to generate an extension module as .so file. You can test it then by importing it from python interpreter :code:`import edlib` and running :code:`edlib.align(...)` (you have to be positioned in the directory where .so was built). This is useful for testing while developing.

Run :code:`make sdist` to create a source distribution, but not publish it - it is a tarball in dist/ that will be uploaded to pip on `publish`. Use this to check that tarball is well structured and contains all needed files, before you publish.
Good way to test it is to run :code:`sudo pip install dist/edlib-*.tar.gz`, which will try to install edlib from it, same way as pip will do it when it is published.

Run :code:`make publish` to create a source distribution and publish it to the PyPI. Use this to publish new version of package.
Make sure to bump the version in `setup.py` before publishing, if needed.

:code:`make clean` removes all generated files.
